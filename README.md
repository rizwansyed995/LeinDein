1. Project Name: LeinDein

2.Project Description: LeinDein is a decentralized freelance payment platform built on the Cardano blockchain. It uses a smart contract to create a secure escrow system, allowing clients and freelancers to transact directly with trust and transparency.

3. What problem you are trying to solve: The current freelance market is broken. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr charge high fees (up to 20%), and there's always a risk of late payments or disputes. LeinDein fixes this by removing the expensive middleman, ensuring freelancers get paid fairly and clients get the work they paid for. Â
